# dotfiles

My dotfiles are a major work in progress and are under constant revision as I discover ways to be a more productive developer. Feel free to use anything you may find useful.

Because this repo is intended for my private use and is made public for informational purposes only, I won't be accepting issues or pull requests.

Best wishes on your search for your ideal configs.
